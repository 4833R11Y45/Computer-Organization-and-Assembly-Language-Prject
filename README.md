# Computer-Organization-and-Assembly-Language-Project
We were tasked to create a functional calculator using Assembly Language on EMU8086.
# Project Name: Calculator created by Assembly Language
# Project Description:
The project was created by implementing Assembly Language. The project is capable to perform arithmetic, power and Boolean calculations. The program was looped in such a way that it restarts itself after every calculation.
# How to run the program:
Download the 'coal lab project.asm' file. Firstly, you need to have emu8086 emulator to run this program. After opening the emu8086 windows, drag the file into it. And hit the emulate button. It will take some time to assemble, and then press the run button on the assembler screen. And you are good to go running the program.
# Note:
A 'Snapshot' folder has been added to the repository to show snaps of the program.
