# Computer-Organization-and-Assembly-Language-Prject
We were tasked to create a functional calculator using Assembly Language on EMU8086.
# Project Name: Calculator created by Assembly Language
# Project Description:
The project was created by implementing Assembly Language. The project is capable to perform arithematic, power an boolean calculations. The program was looped in such a way that it restarts itself after every calculation.
# How to run the program:
Download the 'coal lab project.asm' file. Firstly, you need to have emu8086 emulator to run this program. After opening the emu8086 windowa, drag the file into it. And hit the emulate button. It will take some time to assemble. And you are good to go to run the program.
# Note:
A 'Snapshot' folder has been added into the repository to show snaps of the program.
